                    <h3>Welcome to the <i>unbeatable</i> Speed Pairs!</h3>
                    <p>Every day some new hopeful enters my casino and wants to try the game that has never been beaten. None of them stand a chance, but it's 
                    entertaining to watch them tear their hair out trying. Perhaps you'd like to be next?"</p>
                    <h4>How to play</h4>
                    <p>Speed pairs was made for stupid people like... oh nevermind.</p> 
                    <p>It's very simple: just find 12 pairs of cards before the time runs out. A pair can be, 
                        for example, any two eights of any suit. To match two cards, simply click on one and then on the other - if your choices match they will be removed 
                        from the board. But you better be quick, the timer starts as soon as you start the game! Such fun.</p>
                    <p><b>One last thing: </b><i>watch out for the joker. If you click on it, you lose instantly!</i></p>
                    <p>Best of luck and I can't wait to say I told you so.</p>
