                <h2>Welcome to Speed Pairs!</h2>
                <p>Every day some new hopeful enters my casino and wants to try the game that has never been beaten. None of them stand a chance of course, but it's 
                entertaining to watch them gnash their teeth and tear their hair out. Perhaps you'd like to be next?</p>
                <br>
                <b>How to play</b>
                <p>Speed pairs was made for stupid people like... oh nevermind. It's very simple: just find 12 pairs of cards before the time runs out. A pair can be, 
                    for example, any two eights of any suit. To match two cards, simply click on one and then on the other - if your choices match they will be removed 
                    from the board. But you better be quick, the timer starts as soon as you start the game! Such fun.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>One last thing: </b><i>watch out for the joker. If you click on him you lose instantly!</i></p>
                <br>
                <p>Best of luck and I can't wait to say I told you so.</p>

                    perhaps you'd like to try again?</p>
