<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
### About the project
Speed Pairs follows a simple principle in game design: it's simple to play but difficult to beat.

The player is presented with playing cards in a grid and must find (and select) twelve pairs to win, before the clock runs out. The joker card must be avoided, as to click on it means an instant loss.

There is a library of losing messages so the player is likely to see different responses to a loss. In this way, using short bursts of pressure and rewarding failure with something to look forward to, the intention is that the game quickly becomes addictive.
